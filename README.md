# FaceLock: Facial Recognition System

The project aims to develop a facial recognition-based security access application capable of detecting faces under challenging conditions. The program is designed to function effectively even when images are captured in poor lighting. It assumes that images will be still, and the hardware used will automatically enhance image quality by turning on a light if the initial capture is too dark, ensuring better lighting for accurate facial recognition.

Prerequisites (Local):
1. Have PHP and Python installed in your local environment (This project was created with PHP version 8.0.30 and python version ...) or if you are using Visual Studio Code, download PHP and Python extensions. 
2. Install XAMPP (This project was created with XAMPP version 3.3.0)
3. Install relevant Python dependencies:
   pip install ipython
   pip install numpy
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install torch
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install pillow
   pip install dlib
   pip install imutils
   pip install scipy
   pip install websockets
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   pip install requests
   pip install mtcnn
   pip install setuptools
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install openpyxl
   pip install flask
   apt install build-essential cmake
   apt install libx11-dev
5. Start XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL
6. Open your terminal (either local or from Visual Studio Code) and run the WebcamCode.py file
7. Go to Google Chrome and type “http://127.0.0.1/FYP-Homies-FR-System/app/view/login.php”  or “http://localhost/FYP-Homies-FR-System/app/view/login.php”, which will redirect the you to the login page. 

Note: There may be some changes needed to file paths and link depending on where you save your files. Please ensure that your directories are correct when running the program.
